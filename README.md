# Chatbots - Using Natural Language Processing and Tensorflow

## Introduction:
This Jupyter Notebook project aims to build a Chatbot capable of understanding the context of sentences and responding accordingly. 

## Project Overview:
In this project, we will:

1. Transform conversational intents into a Tensorflow model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and save it as a Pickle file.
2. Load the saved Pickle and model to build a framework for processing responses.
3. Demonstrate how inputs are processed and responses are generated.

## Libraries Used:
- **Tensorflow (TFlearn):** A modular and transparent deep learning library built on top of Tensorflow, facilitating experimentations while remaining fully compatible with it.
- **Numpy:** Used for array manipulation and numerical operations.
- **NLTK:** A toolkit for natural language processing, including stemming and tokenization.
- **JSON:** Used for loading and processing intents data.
- **Pickle:** Used for saving and loading Python objects.

## How to Use:
1. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, including TensorFlow, NLTK, Numpy, and TFlearn.
2. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook file `chatbots.ipynb`.
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook to understand and execute the code.
4. Provide user input to interact with the chatbot and observe its responses.
